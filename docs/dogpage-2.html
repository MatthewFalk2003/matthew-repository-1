    <h2 class="pastheader">Past Dogs</h2>
        <p>I have had a few other dogs in the past that I no longer have. These in particular are <span class="nountwo">Amber</span> amd <span class="nountwo">Misha</span>. Both were rescue dogs that we picked up at certain points. <span class="event">Amber tragically passed in 
            early 2022 whilst Misha is a foster we had for a time before she was found a home.</span> Though they are no longer with us for different reasons, I loved and valued them dearly!</p>

    <h2 class="pastheader">Conclusion</h2>    
        <img class="imgtwo" src="images/flowers.jpg" alt="First_Picture"/>
        <p class="conclusion">I think pets really add something to your life. It has been scientifically posited with much evidence that having pets contributes to an individual's emotional well-being. It is
            for that reason in part that saying goodbye to a pet can be so difficult, yet it has always been worth it in my eyes. To know that the time you had with a pet made both them
            and your life a little better is proof that everything is worth it in the end.</p>
